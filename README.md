# Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Rays

This project involves creating an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes (Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19) with a reasonably high accuracy (98.89%) using a ResNet-18 model trained on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset.
